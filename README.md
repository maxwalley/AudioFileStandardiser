# AudioFileStandardiser
This is an application I built in lockdown that allows users to manipulate audio file metadata in a number of useful ways.

This project was generally used for experience in application and GUI construction using the JUCE library. It uses the TagLib library to access and edit file metadata.

The design of this application was very structually different to anything I had made in the past. This was mainly experimental and included the use of a number of patterns such as:
factory,
observer,
mediator,
singleton
